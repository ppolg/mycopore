# Direct RNA sequencing of mycobacteria

Peter Polgar, ISMB, University College London

Supervisors: Dr Kristine Arnvig, Dr Irilenia Nobeli

## Repository information

This repository contains the code used for the first rotation of my Lido PhD, involving direct RNA sequencing of *Mycobacterium smegmatis* with Oxford Nanopore's MinION platform and identification of rRNA processing intermediates. Short descriptions of the R code used to analyse the data and generate the figures are found below.

## Code

### rRNA_read_boundaries



### rRNA_read_groups



### QC_graphs



### tidy_data

## Acknowledgements
A huge thank you to my supervisors, Kristine and Irilenia, for helping me with the project, as well as the other people in the sRNA lab: Alex, Terry and Amy. You guys are ridiculously awesome!

Special thanks for Felix Gr√ºnberger, whose PhD project inspired this rotation, and whose code I *kindly appropriated* on many occasions for my project. Find his code [here](https://github.com/felixgrunberger/Native_RNAseq_Microbes) and his amazing paper on BioRxiv [here!](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.880849v2)

Finally thanks for the Lido programme and the BBSRC for funding my ~~developing alcoholism~~ personal and professional development!
